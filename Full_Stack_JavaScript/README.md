<h2>Knowledge Check</h2>

        Please see below for my answers to the various knowledge checks in TOP Full Stack JavaScript path.

---

<details>
<summary><h3>Emmet</h3></summary>

---

<h4>Why should you use Emmet?</h4>

> It helps you to write HTML and CSS more efficiently by providing access to a range of different shortcuts.

---

<h4>What are some useful Emmet abbreviations?</h4>

> <ul>
> <li><code>!</code> will generate a HTML boilerplate.</li>
> <li>"link:css" will auto populate the css link tag in a HTML file.</li>
> <li>"ul>li*x" will generate a list with x list items.</li>
> <li>"bd+" in CSS will set <code>border:1px solid #000</code></li>
> </ul>

---

<h4>What syntax would you use to create this element <code><\p class="text"><\/p></code>?</h4>

> You would type "p.text".

---

<h4>What syntax expands to an element with a child element inside of it? For example: <code><div><p></p></div></code></h4>

> The greater than (>) symbol.<br>
> The example above would be written "div>p".

---

<h4>What syntax would you use to create three elements that have the same class name?</h4>

> You can use the * symbol.<br>

---

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><h3>SVG - Scalable Vector Graphics</h3></summary>

---

<h4>What is the <code>xmlns</code> attribute?</h4>

> This stands for "XML NameSpace" and specifies the dialect of XML that is being used.

---

<h4>What are some situations where you wouldn’t want to use SVG?</h4>

> SVG is very inefficient at storing complex images which means that photo-realistic or highly detailed/textured images are not good use cases for SVG.

---

<h4>What are the benefits of “inlining” your SVGs? What are the drawbacks?</h4>

> The benefit is that the properties of the SVG will be visible to your code, allowing it to be altered dynamically by CSS or JS.<br>
> The drawback is that your code is harder to read, your page is less cacheable and if the SVG is large the rest of your HTML could take longer to load.

---

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><h3>CSS Functions</h3></summary>

---

<h4>What are the four CSS math functions we covered above?</h4>

> <ol>
> <li><code>calc()</code>: A function that can be used to perform calculations. E.g. <code>--main: calc(100vh - calc(var(--header) + var(--footer)));</code></li>
> <li><code>min()</code>: A function that sets a boundary for the maximum allowed value. E.g. <code>width: min(150px, 100%);</code></li>
> <li><code>max()</code>: A function that sets a boundary for the minimum allowed value. E.g. <code>width: max(100px, 4em, 50%);</code></li>
> <li><code>clamp()</code>: This function takes 3 values being the smallest value, an ideal value and the largest value. E.g. <code>font-size: clamp(320px, 80vw, 60rem);</code></li>

<details>
<summary><h3>Form Validation</h3></summary>

---

<h4>What does the required validation do?</h4>

> Ensures that specific fields are filled out prior to form submission.

---

<h4>What validations can you use for checking text length?</h4>

> You can use both the <code>minlength</code> and <code>maxlength</code> validations for checking text length.<br>
> E.g. <code>minlength="5" maxlength="20"</code> would set a text length requirement between 5 and 20.

---

<h4>How can you validate the minimum and maximum of numeric inputs?</h4>

> By using the <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> validation you can set limits for numerical inputs.
> E.g. <code>min="1" max="5"</code> would limit the numerical input to between 1 and 5.

---

<h4>What can you use the pattern validation for?</h4>

> Pattern validation is useful for ensuring that data matches a particular pattern so that the correct information is obtained from users.<br>

---

<h4>What pseudo CSS selectors are available for styling valid and invalid inputs?</h4>

> You could use both <code>:valid</code> and <code>:invalid</code> pseudo selectors for styling valid/invalid inputs.

<details>
<summary><h3>Introduction to Grid</h3></summary>

---

<h4>How can you use Flex to make a two-dimensional layout?</h4>

> You can use Flex to make a two-dimensional layout by combining multiple flex containers.

---

<h4>Why was CSS Grid introduced?</h4>

> It allows for easy placement of items in both one and two dimensions while maintaining the desired size.

---

<h4>Which CSS layout module would you use to easily make equal sized items in a container?</h4>

> To make equal sized items in a container you would use the CSS Grid layout.

---

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><h3>Creating a Grid</h3></summary>

---

<h4>How does an HTML element become a grid item?</h4>

> A HTML element becomes a grid item when the property of either <code>display: grid</code> or <code>display: inline-grid</code> is applied to it.

---

<h4>What is the space between lines on the grid?</h4>

> The space between lines on a grid is referred to as the "grid track".

---

<h4>How do you set gutters (also known as alleys) in the grid?</h4>

> Gutters/alleys in the grid is the gap between grid rows and columns. This gap can be adjusted with the <code>gap</code> property.<br>
> E.g. <code>gap 10px 50px</code> would set a row gap of 10px and a column gap of 50px.

---

<h4>Describe what happens when you have more content than defined tracks.</h4>

> When there is more content then there are defined tracks, the extra content is placed in an "implicit grid" automatically which follows a similar logic to the "explicit grid".

---

<h4>How could you change the size for those undefined tracks?</h4>

> You can change the size of the implicit grid (undefined tracks) by using <code>grid-auto-rows</code> and/or <code>grid-auto-columns</code>

---

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><h3>Positioning Grid Elements</h3></summary>

---

<h4>Explain the difference between a track and a line.</h4>

> The difference between a track and a line is that a track is essentially any single column or row, and the lines are what divide these tracks.<br>
> It should be noted that tracks have a start and end line, so a 1x3 grid would have horizontal lines ranging from 1 to 4.

---

<h4>What is the smallest unit on a grid?</h4>

> A "cell" is the smallest unit on a grid.

---

<h4>What kind of value do we give to the grid-column-start or grid-column-end properties?</h4>

> We give <code>grid-column-start</code> and <code>grid-column-end</code> a numerical value that defines the line to start/end on.

---

<h4>Which property can we use to combine all the start and end values for a grid item?</h4>

> You can use the <code>grid-area</code> property to combine all the start and end values for a grid item.<br>
> An example of the syntax would be <code>grid-area: 1 / 1 / 3 / 6;</code> which is equal to <code>grid-row-start</code>/ <code>grid-column-start</code>/ <code>grid-row-end</code>/ <code>grid-column-end</code>.

---

<h4>Which grid container property can map out a visual structure of grid items?</h4>

> To map out a visual structure of grid items you can use the <code>grid-template-areas</code> property in the grid container.

---

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><h3>Advanced Grid Properties</h3></summary>

---

<h4>How do you create several grid tracks of the same size without manually typing each one out?</h4>

> You can use the <code>repeat()</code> function to create several grid tracks of the same size.<br>
> An example of how to use it would be: <code>grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 150px)</code>.<br>
> In the above example, we are creating 2 rows, each with a value of 150px.

---

<h4>What is the difference between a static and dynamic size value?</h4>

> The difference between a static and dynamic size value is that static values are fixed at a defined size (e.g. 150px), whereas dynamic values are flexible/responsive sizes.<br>

---

<h4>How can you assign a grid track a flexible value that changes depending on the remaining space available in the grid?</h4>

> To assign a flexible value to a grid track you would use fraction units (<code>fr</code>).<br>
> As an example, a 10 column grid with a total size of 1000px, with each grid item given a column track size of <code>1fr</code> would mean each item is 1/10th of the total size (100px).

---

<h4>How can you assign grid tracks an uneven distribution of the remaining space in a grid?</h4>

> You can assign an uneven distribution to grid tracks by providing a value greater than <code>1fr</code>.<br>
> Using the above example, if we assign the first 2 columns a size value of <code>2fr</code> then they will always take up twice as much size as the <code>1fr</code> values.

---

<h4>Which CSS functions will return the smallest or largest value supplied to them?</h4>

> The functions that will return the smallest or largest value supplied to them are <code>min()</code> and <code>max()</code>.

---

<h4>Which CSS Grid-only function allows you to supply a minimum and maximum track size that is calculated in realtime?</h4>

> For dynamic minimum and maximum track sizes you would use the <code>minmax()</code> function.<br>
> This function is passed two arguments being the minimum size the track can be, as well as the maximum size.<br>
> E.g. <code>grid-template-columns: repeat(5, minmax(100px, 200px));</code> will ensure the column is never less than 100px, or more than 200px.

---

<h4>Which global CSS function allows you to supply a minimum, ideal, and maximum value that is calculated in realtime?</h4>

> The global equivalent of <code>minmax()</code> would be <code>clamp()</code>.<br>
> This function is passed three arguments being minimum-size, ideal-size and maximum-size. It is advisable to use a static size for the minimum and maximum size, and a dynamic value for the ideal size.<br>
> E.g. <code>width: clamp(500px, 80%, 1000px);</code> would create a width equal to 80% of the parent width, down to a minimum of 500px and up to a maximum of 1000px.

---

<h4>What attribute of repeat() can be used to fill in as many grid tracks as possible, given certain constraints?</h4>

> The attributes <code>auto-fit</code> and <code>auto-fill</code> can be used to fill as many grid tracks as possible.

---

<h4>What is the difference between auto-fit and auto-fill?</h4>

> The difference between auto-fit and auto-fill is that auto-fill will leave empty tracks, whereas auto-fit will adjust and stretch the tracks to fill available space without leaving any empty tracks.

<summary><h3>Using Flexbox and Grid</h3></summary>

---

<h4>When might you use Flexbox over Grid?</h4>

> Flexbox is preferable to Grid in Content First Design, where controlling the layout isn't the priority.

---

<h4>When might you use Grid over Flexbox?</h4>

> Grid would be used over Flexbox for Layout First Design, where there is a full understanding of what the finishing container should look like.

---

<h4>When might you use the two of these tools together?</h4>

> The ideal scenario for using both Flexbox and Grid is where you have a Grid layout for your content, but the Grid items set as Flex parents.

<h4>Write an object constructor and instantiate the object.</h4>

> <code>function Book(title, author, pages, read) {<br>
> this.title = title;<br>
> this.author = author;<br>
> this.pages = pages;<br>

> console.log(theHobbit.info()); //output: "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien, 295 pages, not read yet"</code>

---

<h4>Describe what a prototype is and how it can be used.</h4>

> The prototype is an object from which other objects inherit properties. This mechanism allows objects in JavaScript to share behavior and properties.<br>
> Prototype can be used to save memory by having common methods and properties shared among instances, rather than being defined separately each time.

---

<h4>Explain prototypal inheritance.</h4>

> Prototypal inheritance is where objects are able to inherit properties and methods directly from other objects.<br>
> In JavaScript, prototypal inheritance is the primary inheritance mechanism.

---

<h4>Understand the basic do’s and don’t’s of prototypal inheritance.</h4>

> Do's of Prototypal Inheritance:
>
> <ol>
> <li>Use Prototypal Inheritance for Shared Properties/Methods.</li>
> <li>Modify the Prototype, Not Instances.</li>
> <li>Understand the Prototype Chain.</li>
> <li>Utilise Fallbacks for Missing Properties/Chains.</li>
> </ol>
>
> Don'ts of Prototypal Inheritance:
>
> <ol>
> <li>Don't modify Built-in Prototypes.</li>
> <li>Avoid Overwrite Prototypes Directly.</li>
> <li>Avoid Circular References.</li>
> <li>Avoid Modifying Prototypes in shared code.</li>
> </ol>

---

<h4>Explain what Object.create does.</h4>

> <code>Object.create()</code> allows you to create objects that inherit properties and methods from a specified prototype, while also giving you flexibility to add custom properties to the new object.

---

<h4>How does <code>this</code> behave in different situations?</h4>

> The behavior of <code>this</code> varies depending on the context in which it is used:
>
> <ol>
> <li>Global Context: Refers to the global object (e.g. `window` in browsers, `global` in Node.js).</li>
> <li>Regular Function Calls: Refers to the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode).</li>
> <li>Object Methods: Refers to the object on which the method was invoked.</li>
> <li>Constructor Functions: Refers to the newly created instance.</li>
> <li>Event Handlers: Refers to the element that triggered the event (in DOM events).</li>
> </ol>

<summary><h3>Factory Functions and the Module Pattern</h3></summary>

---

<h4>Explain how scope works in JavaScript.</h4>

> Scope in JavaScript is about the current context of a variable.<br>
> Scopes can be either global (declared outside of any functions) or locally scoped (declared within a variable or curly braces).

---

<h4>Explain what closures are and how they help in creating private variables.</h4>

> Closures in JavaScript enable functions to access and remember the variables from their outer scope even after that scope has finished executing.<br>
> They help create private variables by encapsulating these variables within a function's scope, allowing data to be hidden and ensures that they can't be directly accessed or modified from outside the function.

---

<h4>Describe the common issues that you can face when working with constructors.</h4>

> Some common issues include:
>
> <ul>
> <li>Difficulty in Testing and Mocking: Caused if code relies to heavily on constructors (especially those with complex dependencies or side effects).</li>
> <li>Multiple Inheritance: Attempting to mimic this can lead to complex prototype chains or prototype pollution.</li>
> <li>Issues with the 'this' Context: Incorrect binding of 'this'.</li>
> <li>Absence of Proper Encapsulation: All properties and methods are accessible from outside the object.</li>
> </ul>

---

<h4>Describe private variables in factory functions and how they can be useful.</h4>

> Private variables in factory functions are variables that are only accessible from within the scope of the factory function and not from outside.<br>
> This helps in creating more modular and maintainable code while facilitating greater code security.

---

<h4>Describe how we can implement prototypal inheritance with factory functions.</h4>

> Prototypal inheritance can be achieved with factory functions by utilising the <code>object.create()</code> method.

---

<h4>Explain how the module pattern works.</h4>

> The module pattern involves using closures and immediate function invocation.<br>
> This creates a self-contained module with private members (variables and functions) and a public interface.

---

<h4>Describe IIFEs and what they stand for.</h4>

> IIFE = Immediately Invoked Function Expression.<br>
> This is where you wrap your factory function in parentheses and immediately invoke it.

---

<h4>Explain the concept of namespacing and how factory functions help with encapsulation.</h4>

> Namespacing is the concept of organising code by encapsulating it within a specific namespace or container to avoid naming conflicts.<br>
> Factory functions enable this encapsulation by allowing the creation of objects with private variables and methods.

<summary><h3>Classes</h3></summary>

---

<h4>Describe the pros and cons of using classes in JavaScript.</h4>

> The pros of using classes in JavaScript are:
>
> <ol>
> <li>Can improve the syntax via encapsulation.</li>
> <li>Facilitates inheritance which promotes code reuse.</li>
> <li>Provides a constructor function that is called automatically upon object instantiation.</li>
> </ol>
> The cons of using classes in JavaScript are:
> <ol>
> <li>"Classes" don't technically exist in JavaScript and are syntactic sugar over the existing prototype system which can lead to confusion.</li>
> <li>Can become very verbose resulting in greater code complexity or additional libraries.</li>
> <li>Implicit binding of <code>this</code> which can lead to issues when methods are passed as callbacks or used in different contexts.</li>
> </ol>

---

<h4>How does JavaScript’s object creation differ from a language like Java or Ruby?</h4>

> <ul>
> <li>JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance whereas most other languages use class-based inheritance.</li>
> <li>Objects in JavaScript are highly dynamic.</li>
> <li>JavaScript uses a dynamic form of typing called "duck typing" where the focus is on the properties and methods an object has rather than its explicit type.</li>
> </ul>

---

<h4>Explain the differences between object constructors and classes.</h4>

> Some of the key differences between object constructors and classes are:
>
> <ul>
> <li>Classes provide a more concise syntax.</li>
> <li>Classes use the <code>extends</code> keyword for inheritance whereas object constructors are prototype based.</li>
> <li>Function declarations are hoisted whereas class declarations are not (you need to declare the class before using it).</li>
> <li>Methods in classes are defined without the need for the <code>function</code> keyword.</li>
> </ul>

---

<h4>What are “getters” & “setters”?</h4>

> A "getter" method is used to retrieve the value of a property and is defined using the <code>get</code> keyword followed by the property name.
> A "setter" method is used to modify the value of a property and is defined using the <code>set</code> keyword followed by the property name.

---

<h4>Describe computed names and class fields.</h4>

> Computed property names allow you to use an expression as the property name when defining an object.
> Class fields allow you to declare properties directly within a class without the need for a constructor.

---

<h4>Describe function binding.</h4>

> Function binding refers to the process of associating a function with a particular object.

---

<h4>Describe static properties.</h4>

> Static properties are defined using the <code>static</code> keyword and are properties that belong to a class rather than the instance of the class.

---

<h4>Describe private class features.</h4>

> Private properties are created with the <code>#</code> prefix and <strong>CANNOT</strong> be legally referenced outside of the class.<br>
> The privacy encapsulation of these class properties is enforced by JavaScript itself.

---

<h4>How is inheritance used with classes?</h4>

> Inheritance is used with classes with the <code>extend</code> keyword.<br>
> It is a way to create a relationship between classes where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a parent class.

---

<h4>Why is favoring Composition over Inheritance suggested?</h4>

> <ul>
> <li>Flexibility and Extensibility.</li>
> <li>Avoidance of the fragile base class problem.</li>
> <li>Encapsulation.</li>
> <li>Code reusability.</li>
> <li>Reduced coupling.</li>
> <li>Dynamic behavior.</li>
> <li>Easier testing.</li>
> <li>Promotion of code aggregation.</li>

---

<h4>Explain what the concepts “entry” and “output” mean in relation to webpack.</h4>

> In relation to webpack, the concepts "entry" and "output" are key configuration options that define how the bundling process should start and where the bundled files should be generated.

---

<h4>Briefly explain what a development dependency is.</h4>

> A development dependency is a component/library that is necessary for the development, testing or building of a project but is not required for the runtime operation of the final project.

---

<h4>Explain what “transpiling code” means and how it relates to frontend development.</h4>

> Transpiling code means taking code written in one language and converting it to equivalent code in another language (usually at a higher abstraction level).<br>
> In frontend development, this typically involves converting code into a lower-level/more widely supported version to ensure compatibility with older browsers.

---

<h4>Briefly describe what a task runner is and how it’s used in frontend development.</h4>

> A task runner is a tool used to automate repetitive tasks and streamline the build process of a web application.<br>
> These tasks can include code compilation, file minification, image optimization and other preprocessing tasks.

---

<h4>Describe how to write an npm automation script.</h4>

> To write an NPM automation script, you define custom scripts in the "scripts" section of the projects "package.json" file.<br>
> Once defined, these scrips can be run using the <code>npm run 'script name'</code>.

---

<h4>Explain one of the main benefits of writing code in modules.</h4>

> The main benefit of writing code in modules is the enhancement of code organisation and maintainability.<br>
> Enhanced organisation enables better navigation and understanding of the codebase.<br>
> Enhanced maintainability facilitates easier updates, bug fixes and new features without disrupting the entire codebase.

---

<h4>Explain “named exports” and “default exports”.</h4>

> "Named exports" allow you to export multiple entities from a module with specific names.<br>
> "Default exports enable you to export a single, primary entity as the default export.<br>
> These can be used individually or combined depending on application requirements.

<h4>Explain the “Single Responsibility Principle”.</h4>

> The Single Responsibility Principle states that classes/objects/modules should only have one responsibility.<br>
> This doesn't mean that multiple things cannot be performed, but these various things should all facilitate the one responsibility.

---

<h4>Briefly explain the additional SOLID principles.</h4>

> S : Single Responsibility Principle (software entities only have one responsibility)<br>
> O : Open/Closed Principal (software entities are closed for changes but open for extendability)<br>
> L : Liskov Substitution Principal (if A is a subtype of B, then objects of type B may be replaced with objects of type A)<br>
> I : Interface Segregation Principal (no client should be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use)<br>
> D : Dependency Inversion Principal (high-level modules should depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations)<br>

---

<h4>Explain what “tightly coupled” objects are and why we want to avoid them.</h4>

> Tightly coupled objects are objects that rely so heavily on each other that altering one will mean that you have to completely change another one.<br>

<summary><h3>Form Validation with JavaScript</h3></summary>

---

<h4>Explain the importance of validating HTML forms before submitting them to a server.</h4>

> Validating forms prior to submission is important because it ensures a good user experience by alerting them right away if data is not formatted correctly/is missing.

---

<h4>Describe the two types of client-side form validation.</h4>

> <ul>
> <li>Built-in form validation: This uses HTML form validation features and has better performance than JavaScript validation, but is not as customisable.</li>
> <li>JavaScript: This is completely customisable but needs to be manually created.</li>
> </ul>

---

<h4>Explain how JavaScript Constraint Validation API provides more control and customization of form validation.</h4>

> <ul>
> <li>Allows access to validation properties (e.g. 'validity', 'validationMessage' and 'willValidate').</li>
> <li>Allows you to customise error messages for each validation constraint (using 'setCustomValidity').</li>
> <li>Allows you to add event listeners related to validation events like 'invalid and 'input' enabling custom behaviors or UI updates.</li>
> </ul>

<summary><h3>Asynchronous Code</h3></summary>

---

<h4>What is a callback?</h4>

> A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then executed or called back at a later point in the program's execution, often to handle asynchronous operations or respond to events.

---

<h4>What is a promise?</h4>

> A promise is an object that might produce a value at some point in the future.

---

<h4>When should you use promises over callbacks?</h4>

> Promises are preferable over callbacks in situations where you need to handle asynchronous operations with better readability, error handling, and for avoiding nested callbacks.

---

<h4>What does the .then() function do?</h4>

<summary><h3>Working with APIs</h3></summary>

---

<h4>What is an API?</h4>

> API refers to 'Application Programming Interfaces' and are servers that are created for serving data for use in websites or apps.

---

<h4>How is access to an API restricted?</h4>

> API access is restricted via the use of API keys which usually need to be included with every data request.

---

<h4>How do you fetch and extract data from an API?</h4>

> You utilise <code>fetch('API_URL_HERE')</code> to retrieve data from an API.<br>
> This should return an object and so to extract our data we need to look through the objects layers to find what is required.

---

<h4>Why might your API request be blocked by the browser, and how might you fix this?</h4>

> Your API request could be blocked by the browser as a security precaution.<br>
> To fix this, you can add <code>mode:'cors'</code> inside your <code>fetch('URL_GOES_HERE')</code> (cors=Cross Origin Resource Sharing).

<summary><h3>Async and Await</h3></summary>

---

<h4>How do you declare an async function?</h4>

> You declare an async function by using <code>async</code> before the function.

---

<h4>What does the async keyword do?</h4>

> The <code>async</code> keyword is what lets the JavaScript engine know that an asynchronous function is being declared.

---

<h4>What does the await keyword do?</h4>

> The <code>await</code> keyword tells JavaScript to wait for an asynchronous action to finish before continuing the function.

---

<h4>What is returned from an async function?</h4>

> When a function is declared with <code>async</code> a promise is automatically returned.

---

<h4>What happens when an error is thrown inside an async function?</h4>

> When an error is thrown inside an async function then the promise is rejected.

---

<h4>How can you handle errors inside an async function?</h4>

> To handle errors inside an async function you can call the function and append a <code>.catch()</code> method to the end.<br>
> Alternatively you can utilise the <code>try/catch</code> block inside your async function.

<summary><h3>Recursive Methods</h3></summary>

---

<h4>How would you briefly define a recursive function?</h4>

> A recursive function is a function that calls itself.

---

<h4>What is the point of recursion? Is it more efficient than using a plain loop?</h4>

> The point of recursion is to enhance conciseness and ease of understanding with certain types of problems.<br>
> They are not always more efficient than using a plain loop and this is dictated by the nature of the problem being solved.

---

<h4>What are the 2 essential parts in a recursive function?</h4>

> <ol>
> <li>The base case: When triggered this will terminate the recursive process.</li>
> <li>The recursive case: When triggered this will facilitate recursion.</li>
> </ol>

---

<h4>Why is “stack overflow” relevant to a recursive problem?</h4>

> "Stack overflow" is relevant to a recursive problem because by their nature, they involve repeated function calls, and if not managed properly will consume all available memory used for function call management (stack overflow).

<h4>What is the difference between a stack and a queue?</h4>

> The difference between a stack and a que is that elements in a stack are added to the top and also removed from the top (like a stack of books), whereas elements in a que are added to the top and removed from the bottom (like people in a queue waiting to be served).

---

<h4>What are the enqueue and dequeue properties?</h4>

> Enqueue is when you "start waiting".
> Dequeue is when its your turn to be served.

---

<h4>What is a linked list? What is a node?</h4>

> A linked list is a linear collection of data elements of any type. These data elements are what are referred to as 'nodes'.<br>
> Each node has a value and points to the next node in the linked list.

---

<h4>Which recursive problem-solving method/algorithm design principle does binary search implement?</h4>

> Binary search implements the "divide and conquer" design principle where the array is divided into two halves repeatedly until the target element is found of the search space is exhausted.

---

<h4>What abstract data type would you use to defer/store nodes in a breadth-first tree traversal?</h4>

> To store nodes in a breadth-first tree transversal you would use a data structure known as a "queue" which follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle.

---

<h4>What abstract data type would you use to defer/store nodes in a depth-first tree traversal?</h4>

> For a depth-first tree transversal you would use a data structure known as "stack" which follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.

<summary><h3>Working with Remotes</h3></summary>

---

<h4>What is a safe way to push history changes to a remote repository?</h4>

> A safe way to push history changes to a remote repository is <code>git push --force-with-lease</code>.<br>
> This is because if the branch you're attempting to push to has been updated you will receive an error to notify you.

---

<h4>What are the dangers of history-changing operations?</h4>

> The dangers of history-changing operations mainly occur when collaborating with others. This is because the work of others can be irreversibly destroyed.

---

<h4>What are best practices of history-changing operations?</h4>

> <ul>
> <li>Ensure if working on a team project that rewriting history is safe and others are aware of your intent.</li>
> <li>Ideally only use these commands on branches you are working on by yourself.</li>
> <li>Don't push after every single commit, changing published history should be avoided where possible.</li>

---

<h4>Can you directly send your changes to a repository that you don’t own/have write access to?</h4>

> You cannot directly send your changes to a repo that you don't own or have write access to. You would be required to make a "pull request".

---

<h4>What should you do immediately before merging your feature branch into main?</h4>

<summary><h3>More Testing</h3></summary>

---

<h4>What is tightly coupled code?</h4>

> Tightly coupled code refers to functions that heavily reference external functions or variables.

---

<h4>What are the two requirements for a function to be pure?</h4>

> <ol>
> <li>If the same arguments are passed in, the same result is always returned. It must only depend on its input arguments.</li>
> <li>The function does not produce any observable side effects such as network requests, input and output devices, or data mutation.</li>
> </ol>

---

<h4>What are side effects and why is it important to identify them when testing a function?</h4>

> An observable side effect is any interaction with the outside world from within a function. For a function to remain pure, they must not contain any side effects.

---

<h4>What are two solutions to the tightly coupled code problem?</h4>

> <ol>
> <li>Remove dependencies from the code.</li>
> <li>Mocking</li>
> </ol>

---

<h4>What is mocking?</h4>

> Mocking is writing 'fake' versions of a function that always behave exactly how you want.

---

<h4>When would you use a mock function?</h4>

> You would use a mock function whenever you have an input-grabbing function.

---

<h4>How should you test incoming query messages?</h4>

> You should test incoming query messages by testing the expected behavior and outcomes based on the incoming query messages.

---

<h4>Why should you not test implementation?</h4>

> You should test the interface instead of the implementation because if you can test only the interface it means you can change the implementation without breaking the test.

---

<h4>Should you test private methods?</h4>

> You should not test private methods. Do not make assertions about their result and do not expect to send them.

---

<h4>Why should you not test outgoing messages with no side effects?</h4>

> You should not test outgoing messages with no side effects because if the message has no side effects then it is invisible to your app and will add no proof.

<summary><h3>Transform</h3></summary>

---

<h4>What are the four main functions of the transform property?</h4>

> The four main functions of the transform property are <code>rotate</code>, <code>scale</code>, <code>skew</code> and <code>translate</code>.

---

<h4>Which function can be used to move an object through space on the X, Y, or Z axis?</h4>

> You can use the <code>translate</code> function to move an object through space on the X, Y, or Z axis.

---

<h4>Which function can be used to make an object larger or smaller on the X, Y, or Z axis?</h4>

> To make an object larger or smaller on the X, Y or Z axis you can use the <code>scale</code> function.

---

<h4>What additional function is required for 3D transforms?</h4>

> For 3D transforms you also need to include <code>perspective</code>. This sets the distances from the user to the z = 0 plane and must be declared first.

> The short hand notation for transitions is: <code>transition: ;</code>.

---

<h4>What is the stacking context?</h4>

> The stacking context refers to the stacking order of elements on a web page. A stacking context is formed in the following situations:<br>
>
> <ul>
> <li>Root Stacking Context: The root element of the document forms the initial stacking context.</li>
> <li>Elements with a Z-Index other than 'auto' and 'position' other than 'static'.</li>
> <li>CSS 'transform', 'filter', 'clip-path', or 'opacity' Property.</li>
> <ul>

---

<h4>Why do you need to keep an eye on repaints?</h4>

> Keeping an eye on repaints is important in web development because repaints can impact the performance and user experience of a website.<br>
> Repainting refers to the process of updating the pixels on the screen when changes occur, such as updates to the DOM or style changes.

> The short-hand notation for CSS animations is: <code>animation: ;</code>.

---

<h4>How do you add keyframes to an animation?</h4>

> You add keyframes to an animation by declaring <code>@keyframes</code> followed by the animation name.

---

<h4>When would you use an animation over a transition (and vice versa)?</h4>

> You would use an animation over a transition when you need more flexibility and complexity than transition is able to offer.<br>

<details>
<summary><h3>Keyboard Navigation</h3></summary>

---

<h4>What are two things that interactive elements must have for keyboard users?</h4>

> Two things that interactive elements must have for keyboard users are that they are focusable and have event handling for keyboards.

---

<h4>What are focus styles?</h4>

> Focus styles are the styles that apply to an element when it is being focused (typically an outline or border).

---

<h4>Why should you never completely remove focus styles from an element?</h4>

> You should never completely remove focus styles from an element because not having any visual indication of what element has focus makes a page very difficult to navigate and operate for keyboard users.

---

<h4>What is the tab order?</h4>

> Tab order is the order in which elements on the page are focused when pressing the Tab key.<br>
> By default this is the same order as the order of elements listed in the HTML file.

---

<h4>What is the best way to hide hidden content from assistive technologies?</h4>

> The best way to hide hidden content from assistive technologies is by giving the container for the hidden content either a <code>display: none</code> or <code>visibility: hidden</code> CSS property.

---

<details>
<summary><h3>HashMap Data Structure</h3></summary>

---

<h4>What does it mean to hash?</h4>

> To hash means to take an input and generate a corresponding output. When hashing, the same input will always generate the same output and this process IS NOT reversible.

---

<h4>What are buckets?</h4>

> Buckets are storage for elements (basically an array). The hash function returns a number that corresponds to the index of the array at which we store the key value pair.

---

<h4>What is a collision?</h4>

> A collision occurs when two different keys generate the exact same hash code.

---

<h4>When is it a good time to grow our table?</h4>

> It is a good time to grow a hash table when the "load factor" is reached. This is typically between 0.75 and 1 (75-100%) of the maximum capacity.

<details>
<summary><h3>Meaningful Text</h3></summary>

---

<h4>What are three rules you should follow in order to provide meaningful links?</h4>

> <ol>
> <li>Text content of <code>a</code> element should indicate where the link redirects.</li>
> <li>If the link will open or download a file, include text that indicates file type and size.</li>
> <li>If the link will open in a a new tab or window then indicate this in some way.</li>
> </ol>

---

<h4>What information should you inform users of in order to provide meaningful error messages in forms?</h4>

> Ideally you want to inform the user what input caused the error and if possible, how they can fix it.<br>
> e.g. "Error: Password requires 8 characters, password input only 6 characters"

---

<h4>When should you use the empty string/null value for the alt attribute?</h4>

> You should use an empty string/null value for the alt attribute when it is not important for the assistive technology to be aware of the image.

---

<details>
<summary><h3>WAI-ARIA</h3></summary>

---

<h4>What purpose does WAI-ARIA serve?</h4>

> The purpose of WAI-ARIA is to define a way to make web content more accessible when native HTML is unable to do so.

> <li>All interactive ARIA controls must be usable with a keyboard.</li>
> <li>Never use <code>role='presentation'</code> or <code>aria-hidden='true'</code> on focusable elements.</li>
> <li>All interactive elements must have an accessible name.</li>
> </ol>

---

<h4>What is the accessibility tree?</h4>

> The accessibility tree is related to the DOM but only contains accessibility related information that will be used by assistive technologies.

---

<h4>What are the differences between the three ARIA labels?</h4>

> <ol>
> <li><code>aria-label</code>: Overrides any native label of an element and modifies its name property in the accessibility tree.</li>
> <li><code>aria-labelledby</code>: Overrides both the native label and the <code>aria-label</code> attribute and changes an elements accessible name to a concatenated string of the text contents or <code>alt</code> attributes of the labelling elements whose <code>id</code> are passed in.</li>
> <li><code>aria-describedby</code>: Modifies the description property in the accessibility tree.</li>
> </ol>

<summary><h3>Responsive Design</h3></summary>

---

<h4>What is responsive design?</h4>

> Responsive design is a set of techniques that are used to ensure a website works on any size screen.

---

<h4>Why should you avoid fixed width and/or height?</h4>

> Using a fixed width and/or height removes the ability for content to be responsive.

---

<h4>In what situations might it be appropriate to use fixed width or height?</h4>

> Situations where is could be appropriate to use fixed width or height include headers, footers, small icons and sidebars.

---

<h4>Why should you avoid percentages?</h4>

> You should avoid percentages because when responding to changes in screen size the margins will also change.

---

<h4>What is the main difference between object-fit and background-size?</h4>

> <code>object-fit</code> is for <code>img</code> tags, whereas <code>background-size</code> only works with background images.

---

<h4>How can you define a width and a height on an img without distorting it?</h4>

> If you give an image flexible width and set height to auto then the image should not distort.

---

<h4>Why would you want to provide different images at different screen resolutions?</h4>

> It allows you to better control how your image will be displayed at different resolutions.

---

<h4>When would you want to use an img with a srcset vs a picture?</h4>

> If you are only concerned about serving differently-sized versions of the same image to a user then you would use srcset.

---

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><h3>Setting up a React Environment</h3></summary>

---

<h4>What are some of the ways we can start a new React project?</h4>

> Some ways that we can start a new React project include attaching a set of <code>script</code>tags which serve React from a CDN, to robust toolchains and frameworks such as Vite's React Config, Gatsby and NextJS.

---

<h4>Why should we initially be using pre-made toolchains instead of making our own?</h4>

> We should use pre-made toolchains (initially) instead of making our own due to the complexity of writing our own where we would need to configure Package Management, Module bundling, Compilation and React itself (at least).

---

<h4>What is Vite and why would we use it?</h4>

> Vite describes itself as "next generation frontend tooling" and we would use it because it caters to the React Ecosystem while also leveraging the latest technologies to provide a great developer experience.

---

<h4>What command can we run to scaffold a new React project using Vite?</h4>

> To scaffold a new React program using Vite, we can run the following command <code>npm create vite@latest name-of-project -- --template react</code>

---

<h4>What is in the public folder?</h4>

> The public folder is where all the static assets related to the app will go (e.g. images, icons, and information files for the browser).

---

<h4>What is in the src folder?</h4>

> The src folder contains the code that runs the app where the main.jsx file serves as the entry point for the application.

---

<h4>Why are the React Developer Tools useful?</h4>

> React Developer Tools are useful for tracking and making live changes to the moving parts inside the app which helps with understanding and debugging code.

<summary><h3>React Components</h3></summary>

---

<h4>What does a React element look like?</h4>

> An independent, reusable chunk that is referred to as a component.

---

<h4>How would you create a functional component?</h4>

> You create a functional component by defining a function inside a .jsx file. It is important to note that <strong>React components must be capitalized.</strong><br>
> e.g. <code>function Greeting()</code> followed by the function.

---

<h4>How do you export and then import a component?</h4>

> You export the component at the bottom of your .jsx file and then import it inside your main.jsx.

---

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><h3>What is JSX</h3></summary>

---

<h4>What is JSX?</h4>

> JSX is JavaScript XML and lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JS file.

---

<h4>Why do we use JSX?</h4>

> JSX allows React to separate concerns by containing both rendering logic and contents in the same place (a component).<br>
> Additionally, it is typically more intuitive and allows React to show more meaningful error and warning messages.

---

<h4>What are the three rules of JSX?</h4>

> <ol>
> <li>Return a single root element: If multiple elements need to be returned you can wrap them inside a <code>div</code> or a React fragment <code><> </></code>.</li>
> <li>Close all tags: In HTML, some tags are self closing, in JSX however, all tags must be explicitly closed.</li>
> <li>CamelCase <strong>MOST</strong> things: JSX turns into JS, and attributes of elements become keys of JS objects. Due to this, you can't use dashes or reserved words such as <code>class</code>. Instead of <code>stroke-width</code> you'd use <code>strokeWidth</code> and instead of <code>class</code> you'd use <code>className</code></li>
> </ol>

---

<h4>How do you reference a dynamic value inside of your JSX?</h4>

> To reference a dynamic value inside of JSX you wrap it in curly braces: <code>{}</code>.<br>
> This allows you to inject dynamic content.

---

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><h3>Rendering Techniques</h3></summary>

---

<h4>How do you render a list of elements/components in JSX?</h4>

> To render a list of elements/components in JXS you can use the following methods:<br>
>
> <ul>
> <li>Using <code>Array.map()</code></li>
> <li>Using <code>JSX Fragments</code></li>
> <li>Using Conditional Rendering</li>
> </ul>

---

<h4>What are the ways you could render UI conditionally?</h4>

> To render UI conditionally you could use the following methods:<br>
>
> <ul>
> <li>Use the ternary operator</li>
> <li>Using the && operator</li>
> <li>Using <code>if</code><code>if/else</code>, and <code>switch</code></li>
> </ul>

---

<h4>How would you conditionally return JSX?</h4>

> You can conditionally return JSX using the same methods used to render UI conditionally.

---

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><h3>Keys in React</h3></summary>

---

<h4>Why does React need keys?</h4>

> React needs keys because it allows items to be tracked so that changes can be accurately updated and entire lists don't need to be re-rendered.

---

<h4>How do you use keys?</h4>

> You use keys by passing them into the component or DOM element as a prop.

---

<h4>Where should the key value ideally come from?</h4>

> The key value should come from unique id associated with each item.

---

<h4>When can we use an array index as the key value?</h4>

> It is not recommended to use an array index as the key value, but it may be allowable if the list will remain unchanged throughout the applications life.

---

<h4>What is an anti-pattern when using keys?</h4>

> An anti-pattern when using keys to be aware of is that Keys <strong>should never</strong> be generated on the fly. Keys should be inferred from the data itself.

---

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><h3>Passing Data Between Components</h3></summary>

---

<h4>How does data flow between React components? From child to parent? From parent to child? Both?</h4>

> In React, data flow is unidirectional(one way) and is facilitated by the use of props (short for properties).<br>
> Any changes made to this data will only affect child components using the data.

---

<h4>Why do we use props in React?</h4>

> We use props to account for variations in components and reduce code duplication.

---

<h4>How do we define default properties on a React component? What are some benefits in doing so?</h4>

> Default properties are defined on React components by assigning them with <code>.defaultProps</code>.<br>
> The benefit of this is reduced code and duplication as now we only need to define the props if they differ from the default values.

---

<h4>How can we pass functions as props?</h4>

> <ol>
> <li>The function is defined in the parent component.</li>
> <li>A reference to this function is passed through as the value for the prop on the component.</li>
> <li>The function is received in the component and is called on a click event.</li>
> </ol>

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><h3>Introduction to State</h3></summary>

---

<h4>What is state?</h4>

> State is a component's memory and is how the component "remembers" things about itself.

---

<h4>What is the useState hook and how would you use it?</h4>

> The <code>useState</code> hook is a built-in hook that allows you to define state in a functional component.<br>
> It takes an initial value as a parameter and returns an array with two elements that can be destructured to get:
>
> <ol>
> <li>The current state value</li>
> <li>A function to update the state value</li>
> </ol>
> E.g. <code>const [backgroundColor, setBackgroundColor] = useState(initialColor);</code>

---

<h4>What happens to a component when one of its states is changed?</h4>

> When one of a components states is changed it is rerendered in the virtual DOM tree and subsequently updated on the actual DOM.

---

<h4>What are some of the rules of hooks?</h4>

> <ul>
> <li>All hooks can be recognised by the <code>use</code> prefix (e.g. <code>useState</code>).</li>
> <li>Hooks can only be called from the top level of a functional component.</li>
> <li>Hooks can't be called from inside loops or conditions.</li>
> </ul>

---

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><h3>More on State</h3></summary>

---

<h4>What should you keep in mind while declaring state?</h4>

> When declaring state we should keep in mind not to put values that can be calculated using existing values, state, and/or props.

---

<h4>Why should we always use setState to update our state?</h4>

> State should be treated like it is immutable because if it is mutated it can lead to unpredictable results.

---

<h4>What does “state as a snapshot” mean?</h4>

> "State as a snapshot" refers to the fact that state will remain the same throughout the current render of a component.

---

<h4>What’s the difference between passing a value vs a callback to the setState function?</h4>

> When passing a value to the setState function that value <strong>replaces</strong> the current state.<br>
> When passing a callback to the setState function, the latest state is passed in as an argument to the callback.

---

<h4>Why should we always provide a new Object to setState?</h4>

> A new Object should always be provided to setState because if we don't, there is no guarantee that the page will be re-rendered.

---

<h4>Why would you want to control a component?</h4>

> Controlling components is extremely useful when it comes to user input as it ensures the most up to date value is always displayed.

---
