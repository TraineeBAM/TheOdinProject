<details>
<summary><h3>Emmet</h3></summary>

***
<h4>Why should you use Emmet?</h4>

>It helps you to write HTML and CSS more efficiently by providing access to a range of different shortcuts.

***
<h4>What are some useful Emmet abbreviations?</h4>

><code>!</code> will generate a HTML boilerplate.<br>
>"link:css" will auto populate the css link tag in a HTML file.<br>
>"ul>li*x" will generate a list with x list items.<br>
>"bd+" in CSS will set <code>border:1px solid #000</code>

***
<h4>What syntax would you use to create this element <code><p class="text"></p></code>?</h4>

>You would type "p.text".

***
<h4>What syntax expands to an element with a child element inside of it? For example: <code><div><p></p></div></h4></code>

>The greater than (>) symbol.<br>

<details>
<summary><h3>SVG - Scalable Vector Graphics</h3></summary>

***
<h4>What is the <code>xmlns</code> attribute?</h4>

>This stands for "XML NameSpace" and specifies the dialect of XML that is being used.

***
<h4>What are some situations where you wouldn’t want to use SVG?</h4>

>SVG is very inefficient at storing complex images which means that photo-realistic or highly detailed/textured images are not good use cases for SVG. 

***
<h4>What are the benefits of “inlining” your SVGs? What are the drawbacks?</h4>

>The benefit is that the properties of the SVG will be visible to your code, allowing it to be altered dynamically by CSS or JS.<br>
>The drawback is that your code is harder to read, your page is less cacheable and if the SVG is large the rest of your HTML could take longer to load.
